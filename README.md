# sicp-exercise-solutions
My solutions to exercise problems from the book - "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"

# Why?
Aren't there plenty of solutions already available on the internet? (eg: [Scheme Wiki](http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-solutions))

Well, yes but they aren't mine. ðŸ˜‹ Also, I have tried to keep the solutions light and conversational in the hope that it aids understanding. (mine and yours ðŸ˜Š)
